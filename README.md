## Summary

Reports above give a good insight about the number of the employees that are about to retire and hold specific title. However, I believe that additional break down per department will be beneficial for the company. In this case headquarters can see what to expect in each department separately. 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

The table retirement titles contains all the information about the employees that are about to retire in the next four years. To get the number of positions that will be open in next four years an additional query can be ran that breaks down how many staff will retire per department. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?

To ensure that are enough qualified staff for training at Pewlett-Hackard a query with additional filter, that returns only employees on higher positions, assuming that those are qualified as mentors can be ran. With the command "WHERE ut.title IN ('Senior Engineer', 'Senior Staff', 'Technique Leader', 'Manager')" the results include only staff on higher positions.
